Øflo (zeroflo)
==============

Øflo is a [flow based programming](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) framework
for [python](http://python.org/) using [ØMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/).

The library gives you means to define resuable processing units and ways to
combine them to achive complex tasks. It's like unix pipes on steroids. While
the formed network can solve complex problems, each unit stays simple and is
testable on it's own. Furthermore, with FBP you get reusablilty and [parallel
execution](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) for free.
